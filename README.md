* This project is to introduce myself to the Arduino and the HC-05/06 Bluetooth module.
* The code will allow controlling of a RGB led through the HC-06 module with the
* Blynk app through my mobile phone.

*               *** Correction ***
*               HC-06 replaced with HC-05
*               Red pin to pin D11
*               Green pin to pin D10
*               Blue pin to pin D9
